# Probability of Overlap
Here is a repository of the code I wrote that was used in my analysis of a chance overlap between Swift J1728 and SNR G351.9. To use this code, please download all the files in this repository. The .csv are all catalogs from Milky Way distributions in a variety of formats that made it easier for me to read in the data.

We used Milky Way supernova remnant (SNR) (Green 2019) and black hole (BH) (Corral-Santana et al. 2016) catalogs to get
positions of all known SNRs and BHs in the galaxy.

The .ipynb file has some comments. If you have questions or have ideas on improvements, feel free to contact me at bmayura@umich.edu.
